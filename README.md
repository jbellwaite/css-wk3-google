#### By **Jessie Waite**

## Description

A partial reproduction of Google's 'Think with Google' website for week 2 of Epicodus CSS track. The website was made using Materialize, as Materialize was made for/by Google. The website includes the following requirements:

* _Relative units where appropriate_
* _Page responds to three different screen sizes_
* _Images are fluid_
* _Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state_


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the "think-Google" repository to your desktop from GitHub here: https://github.com/jbellwaite/think-Google.git_
* _Open the "think-Google" folder_
* _Open a web-browser, preferably Chrome._
* _Drag "index.html" into an open tab in your web browser to open the application._

_Use a text editor like Atom to edit code._

## Known Bugs

* _I had a really difficult time getting my large screen rows to line up properly. I used Materialize's cards, and each time I tried to size the height of the cards, the content would become jarbled. I used a work-around by adding a media query at the large level, but it still doesn't work exactly as I'd like it to have. _

* _The menu item in the navigation (at the left of the main "Think With Google" logo) doesn't currently work. I didn't have time to get to it, and since it wasn't part of the required portion of the project, I left it for work on later. _

## Technologies Used
